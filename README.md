# WebSocketsAndP5
This is a modernization of [Daniel Schiffman's websockets example](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/web-sockets-and-p5js) updated to use ES6-style. 
Two or more web clients can collaborate on drawing on one 'shared' p5 canvas. 
Also added a text entry box to apply name strings to the little drawing widgets.
